##### Getting to know the vaccine

Like any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild, short term side effects, such as a low-grade fever or pain or redness at the injection site 
Before receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies, COVID-19 vaccines must undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy
There is no overall increased risk of developing a blood clot after receiving any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines, including the vaccine made by AstraZeneca
However, the AstraZeneca vaccine may be associated with extremely rare cases of blood clots that occur in the brain called Cerebral vein sinus thrombosis (CVST) and are associated with low blood platelets. These blood clots were found to occur in approximately 1 in 100,000 people who received the vaccine

Statistics 

27.3% of the worldâ€™s population has received at least 1 dose of the vaccine
13.8% is fully vaccinated
3.89 billion doses have been administered globally 
31.84 million are now administered each day
Of the 9,413,440 Ontarians vaccinated between December 14 and June 12, only 32 people died  

Vaccine Effects

Most reactions to vaccines are mild and go away within a few days on their own
More serious or long-lasting side effects to vaccines are possible but extremely rare 
These include difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, as well as loss of speech or mobility
Moderate and short-lasting effects: fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, diarrhoea, and pain at the injection site
